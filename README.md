# Telco_customer_churn_prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn, built with Python and scikit-learn, designed for telecom companies aiming to reduce customer churn and as a result improve customer retention.

## Overview

This repository contains data analysis, insights, and machine learning modelling for customer churn prediction.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze funding trends and dynamics within the Indian start-up ecosystem.
- Examine sector-wise distribution of funding and geographical trends.
- Identify prominent investors and their impact on start-up funding.
- Provide valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making for investors, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders.

## Framework

The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM).

## Features

- Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, and interpretation.
- Detailed documentation outlining methodology, data sources, and analysis results.
- Interactive visualizations in Power BI showcasing funding trends and key insights.

## Sample Code- used to generate the performance metric of a list of models

```python
def info(models: Union[ValuesView[Pipeline], List[Pipeline]], metric: Callable[..., float], **kwargs) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Generates a list of dictionaries, each containing a model's name and a specified performance metric.

    Parameters:
    - models (List[Pipeline]): A list of model pipeline instances.
    - metric (Callable[..., float]): A function used to evaluate the model's performance. Expected to accept
      parameters like `y_true`, `y_pred`, and `average`, and return a float.
    - **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the metric function or any other function calls inside `info`. Can pass

    Returns:
    - List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries with model names and their evaluated metrics.
    """
    def get_metric(model, kwargs):
         
        # Add default kwargs for callable metric to kwargs. Consider is they are present in kwargs
        if 'X_train' and 'y_train_encoded' in kwargs:
            model.fit(kwargs[X_train], kwargs[y_train_encoded])
        else:
            # Fit final pipeline to training data            
            model.fit(X_train, y_train_encoded)
        
        if 'y_eval_encoded' in kwargs:
            kwargs['y_true'] = kwargs['y_eval_encoded']
        else:
            kwargs['y_true'] = y_eval_encoded
            
        if 'X_eval' in kwargs:
            kwargs['y_pred'] = model.predict(kwargs[X_eval])
        else:
            kwargs['y_pred'] = model.predict(X_eval)   
        
        # Sanitize the metric arguments, use only valid metric parameters
        kwargs = {k: value for k, value in kwargs.items() if k in inspect.signature(metric).parameters.keys()}
        
        return metric(**kwargs)    
    
    info_metric = [
        {
            'model_name': model['classifier'].__class__.__name__,
            f'Metric ({metric.__name__}_{kwargs['average'] if 'average' in kwargs else ''})': get_metric(model, kwargs),
        } for model in models
    ]

    return info_metric
